The virtual navigation benchmark data were collected with following scenarios:

1. sunny env with original models.
2. sunny env with improved models.
3. foggy(5%) env with original models.
4. foggy(5%) env with improved models.

How the gates was counted:

1. There are totally 8 gates in the virtual env.
2. We counted the consecutive num of gates the drone flied through.
3. It was only counted when the drone flied through the gates without colliding on the border.
4. If collision occurred, then stop current round and start next round.
5. Max num is 30, if the drone successfully flied through 30 consecutive gates, then stop current round and start next round.
6. Each above scenario was counted 10 consecutive rounds.
