1. real world simulation

1.1 get into the details of Airsim API and Tello API, and developed the codes to convert Airsim command to Tello command.

1.2 model deployment and real world testing with many impacting factors(wind, lighter weight drone, less powerful camera)

2. CMVAE model training/testing results improvement on 50k dataset

3. BC model training/testing results improvement on 50k dataset with CMVAE model in point 2

4. performance improvement in virtual env, comparison result in standard env and foggy env

5. virtual video with model in point 2 and point 3
