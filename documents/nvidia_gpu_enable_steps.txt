Packages needed:

CUDA Toolkit: an installation exe, size around 2G. 

CUDNN: a zip file which is around 300M, no need installation, just unzip it and config dll in bin/ to PATH env variable

1. check tensorflow-GPU compatible CUDA and CUDNN versions

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows -> GPU

2. check local driver version

Nvidia control panel -> System information

3. check CUDA Toolkit and its compatible driver versions

https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html
In "Table 2. CUDA Toolkit and Compatible Driver Versions"

4. get according CUDNN base on Cuda version

5. windows setup

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#windows_setup

my local installations:
1. driver version: 442.23
2. cuda_10.0.130_411.31_win10.exe
3. cudnn-10.0-windows10-x64-v7.4.1.5
